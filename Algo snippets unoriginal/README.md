The snippets you are asked to code way too often in competitive programming.

Code is intentionally simplified (no references, templates, inheritance, try-catches or stuff like that) so that you do not need to read a 300 pages long book to understand it. You are supposed to just copy and paste it during contest with minimal changes.

Use at your own risk. I am pretty sure it at least compiles, but may contain minor bugs.

Pull requests are welcome, since I do not do contests so actively anymore.

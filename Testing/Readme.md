TL;DR .
write files generator , a , a_good and then Run checker.py.

(in detail).
To test your code do these 3 steps.
1. Complete the make_test() function of generator (it will hardly take 5 to 7 lines of code if you use generator functions given in the file. See demo and example in the file.) . 
2. save your to_be_tested code in a.cpp and save a brute force or a correct(Model) solution a_good.cpp.
3. Run checker.py in python (you can change it to python3 in less than 1 minute). 


The python script will stop after running 1000 random test cases correctly or if it find a test case where there is different output for a and a_good.(It will print the case too :)
If you find a bug , DM me or create an issue on github.
